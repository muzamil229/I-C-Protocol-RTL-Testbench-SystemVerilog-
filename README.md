# I-C-Protocol-RTL-Testbench-SystemVerilog-


This repository includes a SystemVerilog implementation of an IÂ²C master-slave communication protocol featuring 7-bit addressing, ACK/NACK handling, and clock stretching support. The RTL modules handle data transfer, SCL/SDA synchronization, and protocol-compliant response logic. A UVM-style testbench verifies functionality under both normal and stretch conditions using structured stimulus generation and assertions for protocol correctness.
